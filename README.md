# KhulnaSoft Webhooks

Package webhooks provides type definitions and documentation for the webhooks that the KhulnaSoft Platform sends.

This is designed as a Go library that can be used directly in your application to parse webhook payloads,
but also serves as documentation for other languages to implement your own webhook data structures.
